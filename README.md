## Changes Made

### 1. Simplified and Organized Code
- **Removed redundant comments and unused imports**: Kept only necessary comments and removed unused code.
- **Combined similar operations**: Simplified the logic by combining similar operations.
- **Used concise code**: Made the code more concise and readable by using list comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions.
- **Simplified plotting and visualization code**: Reduced the complexity of plotting code.
- **Ensured no redundant code is present**: Removed repeated code and combined similar operations.

### 2. Created Functions for Better Organization
- **Data Loading**: Function `load_data` to load the dataset.
- **Assign Columns**: Function `assign_columns` to assign type, image ID, and source based on image name.
- **Group and Pivot**: Function `group_and_pivot` to group data by 'person-ID' and 'type', then pivot the table.
- **Drop Columns**: Function `drop_columns` to drop columns containing specific substrings.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Function `correlation_analysis` to perform correlation analysis and select the most unique features.
- **t-SNE Clustering**: Function `tsne_clustering` to perform t-SNE clustering and plot the results.
- **UMAP Clustering**: Function `umap_clustering` to perform UMAP clustering and plot the results.
- **PCA Analysis**: Function `pca_analysis` to perform PCA analysis and print the explained variance ratio and top features.
- **PCA Visualization**: Function `pca_visualization` to visualize PCA results and save the plot.

### 3. Main Function to Run the Analysis
- **Main Function**: `main` function to run the entire analysis process, integrating all the above functions.

### 4. Improved Documentation
- **Added Detailed Docstrings**: Provided detailed docstrings for all functions to explain their purpose, parameters, and return values.
- **Organized Code Structure**: Ensured the code is well-organized and easy to understand by breaking it down into modular functions.
